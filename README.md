# ArrayScript
This repository is showing examples of how Arrays are used in Bash scripting. 

In this code I practiced initializing arrays, adding elements to them, accessing specific elements, and determining the number of elements in an array. These skills are crucial for more advanced shell scripting tasks, especially when dealing with lists of data or when you need to perform operations on multiple items. Arrays provide a powerful way to organize and manipulate data in your shell scripts, making your code more efficient and easier to manage.
